HOUSE PARTY

Welcome to House Party, the app that plans a party perfect for you! From booze to tunes, we provide a user-friendly way to search for your favorite music and to see what you can make with whatever booze you happen to have lying around. Good drinks and good music, what else could you ask for?

Instructions:

1.  Click the logo on the landing page to be transported to the main site.

2. You will see an input box with the placeholder "Pick your poison!". In this box, type whatever liquor      you want to search. Once you have typed in you liquor, press enter or click the "search" button with       the martini glass icon. You can also click the "random" button with the question mark icon to return       a random item.

3. The site will search for a drink that is perfect for the liquor you have on hand. The name and an image    of the drink returned will be displayed below the search box. The ingredients and amounts of said          ingredients will be displayed to the right of the drink name and image and the directions for preparing    your drink will appear below everything else.

4. Type in another liquor to search for a new drink. Each new search replaces the previous search's           information on screen.

5. Once you have searched for a drink, another search field with the placeholder "Music for your mood!"       will appear next to the drink search field. Enter a musical genre or band's name into this box and then    click the search button with a music note icon located beneath the search field.

6. Below the drink information, five search results will appear for playlists matching your musical search    term. Click any of the results to bring that playlist up on screen via the YouTube player. You can also    enter a new search and pull up 5 new results.

7. Now you can play and control this playlist via the YouTube player's controls. There are two buttons        that appear directly above the youtube player. The first, labeled "back to result", will return you to     the 5 playlists that were returned on your last search. The second button, labeled "hide/show", will       collapse the YouTube player out of view, tidying up your screen real estate. 

8. Start a playlist and then hit the "hide/show" button and it will play in the background and change         songs automatically. Now that you've set the mood, reference our handy drink recipe and enjoy your         House Party!
